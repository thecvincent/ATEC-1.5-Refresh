        <p>The Edith O’Donnell Arts and Technology Building is home to 155,000 square feet of space for programs in the visual arts, emerging media technology and multimedia communications, as well as 1,200-seat lecture hall.
        <p>The ATEC building showcases student art and major multimedia art exhibitions, and highlights unique courses that demonstrate the intersection of computer science and engineering with creative arts and the humanities.</p>
        <p>This new space is located in the heart of campus, adjacent to the Eugene McDermott Library and facing the newly renovated mall and reflecting pools. Designed by Studios Architecture, the same company that designed Google's Silicon Valley headquarters, the ATEC building includes room for game design, sound design and visual arts, conference rooms, 2-D drawing and painting art studios, 3-D art studios, a recording studio, and photography and print-making labs.</p>
        <p>Collaborative research with the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science is underway in robotics and digital fabrication laboratories.</p>
        <p>The building's exterior courtyard features a natural habitat and a sculpture in collaboration with the Nasher Sculpture Center.</p>

        <p>The Arts and Technology building at UT Dallas bears the name of one of Texas’ most generous philanthropists in honor of her long-standing dedication to higher education, scientific research and the arts.</p>
        <p>Known for their civic and business leadership, Edith O’Donnell and her husband, Peter, and the O’Donnell Foundation they established, have given exceptionally generous support to UT Dallas since 1984. During the last 30 years, the couple’s foundation has contributed more than $600 million to support scientific research and education in America. The couple and the O’Donnell Foundation have given more than $135 million to UT since 1983.</p>
        <p>Peter O’Donnell earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics at the University of the South in Tennessee and a master’s degree in banking and finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Edith O’Donnell earned her bachelor’s degree in psychology from The University of Texas at Austin.</p>
        <p>The O’Donnell Foundation is the fifth largest independent foundation in Dallas. It primarily supports engineering, science and math education along with arts programs. The foundation has been a leader in support of advanced placement programs for high school students and for advancing K-12 education, in addition to its support of higher education.</p>
